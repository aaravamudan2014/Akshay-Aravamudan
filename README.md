My name is Akshay Aravamudan. 
  I am currently a fourth year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Florida Institute of Technology. My research primarily comprises of machine learning applications. Under that rather broad umbrella, I have and continue to work on stochastic temporal point processes, machine learning on the edge and machine learning for hydrology. I graduated with my Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering from Florida Institute of Technology on July of 2019. The following page is used to track my current research interest and to maintain a record of works, both academic and extra-curricular, that I have completed throughout my ongoing academic career. You can find my resume [here](https://www.github.com/aaravamudan2014/Akshay-Aravamudan/blob/master/docs/Akshay_Aravamudan_resume.pdf). A collection of my published papers presentations can also be found on my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qLU7cGgAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Bio

I joined [Florida Tech](https://www.fit.edu) at 2014 to purse my Bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I started with an interest in microcontrollers and microcomputers. During my undergraduate years, I developed a passion for machine learning, starting with a naive bayes classification tool. I got interested in the intricacies involved in developing complex models, which eventually led me down the path of neural networks. I ended up taking courses like Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks. I continued onto pursue my Master's degree, working under adviesement of [Dr. Georgios Anagnastopolous](https://www.fit.edu/faculty-profiles/3/georgios-anagnostopoulos/). My master's thesis dealt with the study of information spread and more specifically utilizing it better understand the spread of software vulnerabilities in their domains.

<!-- <h3 id="masters-thesis">Master’s thesis</h3>

<p>The title of my Master’s thesis is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Survival Analysis for Information Diffusion</code> and can be found <a href="docs/Master_s_Thesis___Akshay_Aravamudan.pdf">here</a>. The main theme of the thesis is information diffusion; the spread of information within a network. The model is based on nodes and we look at how the infection of a node or collection of nodes in a network influences the future infection (referred to as intensity in stochastic process literature) of the remaining nodes. We have built upon an existing algorithm called <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/netrate-netsci14.pdf"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Netrate</code></a>. The presentation slides can be found <a href="docs/Akshay___MS_Thesis_Defense_Presentation.pdf">here</a></p>

<h3 id="senior-design">Senior Design</h3>

<p>I was the controls systems lead in my senior design project <code class="highlighter-rouge">MorphWing</code>. We designed, manufactured and engineered a wing designed to dynamically adjust to the state of optimal drag. I was responsible for the backend circuit setup and <a href="https://github.com/aaravamudan2014/morphWingBackEnd">code</a>. Below are a few images and a gif of the final product that we presented in the 2018 Senior Capstone design at Florida Tech.</p>
