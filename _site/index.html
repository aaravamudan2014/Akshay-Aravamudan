<p>My name is Akshay Aravamudan. I am currently a PhD student in computer engineering at Florida Institute of Technology. My primary interests are Machine learning, Data Science and Stochastic Point Processes. I recently (July 2019) graduated with my Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering from Florida Institute of Technology. The following page is used to track my current research interest and to maintain a record of works, both academic and extra-curricular, that I have completed throughout my college career. You can find my resume <a href="docs/Akshay_Aravamudan_resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>

<p>I joined <a href="https://www.fit.edu">Florida Tech</a> at 2014 to purse my Bachelor’s degree in computer engineering. I started with an interest in microcontrollers and microcontrollers. During my undergraduate years, I developed a passion for machine learning, starting with a simple classification tools. I got interested in the intricacies involved in developing complex models, which eventually led me down the path of neural networks. I ended up taking courses like Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks. I continued onto pursue my Master’s degree, working under my thesis advisor <a href="http://phoenix.fit.edu/~georgio/">Dr. Georgios Anagnastopolous</a>. My master’s thesis dealt with the study of information spread and more specifically applying it to the analysing the spread of software vulnerabilities.</p>

<h3 id="masters-thesis">Master’s thesis</h3>

<p>The title of my Master’s thesis is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Survival Analysis for Information Diffusion</code> and can be found <a href="docs/Master_s_Thesis___Akshay_Aravamudan.pdf">here</a>. The main theme of the thesis is information diffusion; the spread of information within a network. The model is based on nodes and we look at how the infection of a node or collection of nodes in a network influences the future infection (referred to as intensity in stochastic process literature) of the remaining nodes. We have built upon an existing algorithm called <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/netrate-netsci14.pdf"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Netrate</code></a>. The presentation slides can be found <a href="docs/Akshay___MS_Thesis_Defense_Presentation.pdf">here</a></p>

<h3 id="senior-design">Senior Design</h3>

<p>I was the controls systems lead in my senior design project <code class="highlighter-rouge">MorphWing</code>. We designed, manufactured and engineered a wing designed to dynamically adjust to the state of optimal drag. I was responsible for the backend circuit setup and <a href="https://github.com/aaravamudan2014/morphWingBackEnd">code</a>. Below are a few images and a gif of the final product that we presented in the 2018 Senior Capstone design at Florida Tech.</p>
